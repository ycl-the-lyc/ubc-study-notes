== Email
Emails are mostly used in workspace, backed up in the service provider's or company's server.
That means emails are very likely monitored, and hence we should use emails professionally.

To write concise emails,
- use simple sentence structure, reduce the use of complex or composite structure;
- use technical terms wherever possible in place of long phrases;
- be not persuasive when unnecessary to reduce repetition.

To format emails,
- for plain text email, hit the "convert all to plain text" button;
- use a vertical ruler to break lines too long;
- ensure all users' email client support fonts and formats used;
- use email templates.

To manage emails,
- use an email service and clients with encryption like GPG;
- include tracking number or ticket ID in subject line;
- set send delay to greater than 30s to be able to recover accidentally sent emails.

== Generic Correspondent
+ Introduction: purpose statement and context.
+ Body: details.
+ Conclusion: next steps, timeline and contact information.
