  / Charge: Eletric charge, denoted $q$.
    It is measured in coulombs, $coulomb()$.

    An electron carries $coulomb(-1.602e-19)$ of charge, which is the smallest amount of charge in our discussion.
    Its charge counterpart, a protone, carries that amount of positive charge.

  / Current: Eletric current, denoted $i$.
    It is measured in coulombs per second, $coulombps()$.
