=== Important Notes
- relationships within members get BETTER over time
  - this includes storming, as team members are more willing to speak their minds
- conflict occurs at all stages

=== Good vs Bad Norming
- Good norming is healthy
- Bad norming --> team dysfunction
  - e.g. one team member routinely misses meetings and team does nothing

-  
  - *Avoiding* good when tensions high
  - *Accommodating* good when the issue matters more to the other party
  - *Competing* good when issue is self-critical and immediate
  - *Compromising* good if time is short and relationships/problem must be balanced
  - *Collaborating* when you have time to work towards finding the ideal solution for everyone
- _Good teams change their style as situation demands_
