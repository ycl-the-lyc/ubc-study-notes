= Set
#definition(title: [Set])[
  A collection of objects.
  The objects are referred to as elements or members of the set.

  Ordering of a set and occurrences of its elements are trivial.
]

#example(title: [Building sets])[
  - $Set(n^2, n in ZZ) = {0, 1, 4, 9, 16, ...}$
  - $Set(x in RR, x^2 - 2 = 0) = {-sqrt(2), +sqrt(2)}$
  - $Set(x in ZZ, x^2 - 2 = 0) = nothing$
  - $Set(x^2, x in (-3, 1]) = [0, 9)$
  - $A = Set(1 / n, n in NN), B = Set(x in A, x < 1 / (2 pi)) -> B = {1 / 7, 1 / 8, 1 / 9, ...}$
]

#example(title: [Building more sets])[
  Let $A = {..., -8, -4, 0, 4, 8, ...}, B = {..., -6, -3, 0, 3, 6, ...$.
  $
    A & = Set(4 n, n in ZZ) \
    B & = Set(3 k, k in ZZ)
  $
  Let C be the set of all elements which are sums of an element from A and an element from B.
  $
    C & = Set(4n + 3k, n, k in ZZ) \
      & = Set(x + y, x in A, y in B) \
      & = Set(m in ZZ, m = 4x + 3y, x, y in ZZ)
  $
]

#definition(title: [Cardinality of Set])[
  For a set $S$, cardinality is the number of elements in it, $abs(S)$, even when they cannot be definitely counted.
]


#theorem(title: [Set Equality])[
  For sets $S, T$,
  $
    S = T iff (S subset T) and (T subset S)
  $

  #example[
    $
      S = Set(3x + 7y, x, y in ZZ)
    $
    For any $x = -2y$, note that $x, y in ZZ$,
    $
      3x + 7y & = -6y + 7y \
              & = y \
              & therefore ZZ subset.eq S
    $
    Also, every element of $S$ is of the form $3x + 7y$,
    $
           x, y & in ZZ \
      (3x + 7y) & in ZZ \
                & therefore S subset.eq ZZ
    $
    Thus, $S = ZZ$.
  ]
]

In essence, to prove set equality, we need to show that "every element of S is made by rules of T" and "every element of T is made by rules of S".

#theorem(title: [BÃ©zout's Identity])[
  Let $a$ and $b$ be integers with greatest common divisor $d$. Then there exist integers $x$ and $y$ such that $a x + b y = d$. Moreover, the integers of the form $a z + b t$ are exactly the multiples of $d$.

= Logic

#definition(title: [Statement])[
  A claim that is either true false, and there is only once case which it is true.
]

#definition(title: [Open Sentence])[
  A sentence whose truth value depends on the variable(s) that it contains.
]

Statements and open sentences are mutually exclusive, since statements have defined truth value, while open sentences have variables not _clearly_ defined, thus have no clearly defined truth cases.

To think of them mathematically, a statement is a variable, an open sentence is a function.

#definition(title: [Implication])[
  For statements $P$ and $Q$, if $P$ implied $A$, $P implies Q$, then if $P$ is true, $Q$ must be true.
  _An implication is true unless proven false._

  #table(
    columns: 3,
    table.header($P$, $Q$, $P implies Q$),
    [T], [T], [T],
    [T], [F], [F],
    [F], [T], [T],
    [F], [F], [T],
  )
]

Generally, "if... then..." indicates an implication.

To prove an implication, the typical workflow is
+ assume the hypothesis of implication is true;
+ work...;
+ show that $P: T implies Q: F$ cannot happen.
Since the implication _cannot be false_, it must be true.

== Parity and Divisibility

#definition(title: [Parity])[
  A number $n$ is even if $n = 2k$ for some integer $k$.

  A number $n$ is odd if $n = j + 1$ for some integer $j$.
]

To prove parity,
+ substitute variable with the definition of even/odd number;
+ factor expression, most likely with $2$ since it is the coefficient in the definitions;
+ find definition of even/odd number, $2("some integer") "or" 2("some integer") + 1$.

Here, we introduce a crucial proof procedure: starting with assumptions, not the hypothesised implication.
#proof[
  Let $x in RR$. Prove that if $x > 0$, then $x + 2 / x > 2$.

  Multiply all terms by $x$, signs are unchanged since $x > 0$; move all terms to LHS.
  $
        x + 2 / x & >2 \
     x^2 - 2x + 2 & > 0 \
    (x - 1)^2 + 1 & > 0.
  $
  We can prove that the LHS function is continuous and has a minimum value of 1, but we _cannot start with the answer!_

  To start with the conditions, which is logical, we assume $x in RR, x > 0$.
  Note that
  $
                (x - 1)^2 & >= 0 \
    implies (x - 1)^2 + 1 & > 0 \
     implies x^2 - 2x + 2 & > 0 \
    implies x^2 + 2 > 2x.
  $
  we divide all terms by $x$, with $x > 0$ all signs is unchanged,
  $
    x + 2 / x > 2.
  $
]

#lemma(title: [Contrapositive])[
  The contrapositive of $P implies Q$ is
  $
    (neg Q) implies (neg P).
  $
  The contrapositive is _logically_ equivalent to the original statement.
]

Note that $(P implies Q) implies.not (neg P implies neg Q)$, as $P implies Q$ does not require $P$ to be true.

#lemma(title: [Converse])[
  The converse of $P implies Q$ is
  $
    Q implies P
  $
  which may not be true.
]

#lemma(title: [DeMorgan's Laws])[
  $
     neg (P or Q) & equiv (neg P) and (neg Q) \
    neg (P and Q) & equiv (neg P) or (neg Q)
  $
]

#lemma(title: [Implication])[
  $
    (P implies Q) equiv (neg P) or Q

#lemma(title: [Bicondition])[
  $
    (P <implies Q) equiv (P implies Q) and (Q implies P)
  $
]

#lemma(title: [Exclusive Or])[
  $ (P xor Q) equiv (P and neg Q) or (neg P and Q) $
]

#example[
  Using all four lemmas: implication, bicondition, DeMorgan's Laws and exclusive or,
  $
        (P <implies Q) & equiv (P implies Q) and (Q implies P) \
    neg (P <implies Q) & equiv neg ((P implies Q) and (Q implies P)) \
                       & equiv neg (P implies Q) or neg (Q implies P) \
                       & equiv neg (neg P or Q) or neg (neg Q or P) \
                       & equiv (P and neg Q) or (Q and neg P) \
                       & equiv (P and neg Q) or (neg P and Q) \
                       & equiv P xor Q

== Modular Arithmetic

#definition(title: [Congruent and modulus])[
  Let $a, b in ZZ$ and $n in NN$, $a$ is congruent to $b$ modulo $n$ when $n divides (a - b)$.
  The $n$ is referred to as the modulus.
  $ a equiv b modulo(n) $
  If not, then $a$ is not congruent to $b$ modulo $n$, $a equiv.not b modulo(n)$
]

Or to put it simply, a smaller number that yields the same reminder to the modulus.

#theorem(title: [Modular Arithmetic])[
  Let $n in NN, a, b, c, d in ZZ$ such that
  $ a equiv c modulo(n) quad "and" quad b equiv d modulo(n). $
  Then,
  $ a + b equiv c + d modulo(n), quad a - b equiv c - d modulo(n), quad a b equiv c d modulo(n) $
]

Division modular arithmetic is avoided in this course.

#example[
  $
    12 times 108 & equiv ? modulo(5) \
              12 & equiv 2 modulo(5) \
             108 & equiv 3 modulo(5) \
    12 times 108 & equiv 2 times 3 equiv 6 equiv 1 modulo(5)
  $
]

To proof congruency, we should factor out the modulus to show that $n divides a - b$.

#proof[
  Let $n in ZZ$, then $n equiv 3 modulo(5) iff 5 divides (3n + 1)$.

  By definition, from the LHS there exists some integer $k$ that
  $
         n & = 3 + 5k \
        3n & = 9 + 15k \
    3n + 1 & = 10 + 15k \
           & = 5 (2 + 3k).
  $
  Since $2 + 3k & in ZZ$, $5 & divides 3n + 1$.
  Thus, $n equiv 3 modulo(5) implies 5 divides (3n + 1)$

  On the RHS, $15 divides 9n + 3$, so there exists some integer $l$ that
  $
             9n + 3 & = 15l \
      (10n - n) + 3 & = 15l \
      10n - 15l + 3 & = n \
    3 + 5 (2n - 3l) & = n.
  $
  Since $2n - 3l in ZZ$, $5 divides n - 3$.
  Thus, $5 divides (3n + 1) implies n equiv 3 modulo(5)$.

  Therefore, $n equiv 3 modulo(5) iff 5 divides (3n + 1)$.
